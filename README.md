Performance Assessment for WGU D326 Advanced Data Management

This is a project where a business case for a DVD rental store is created by quering a premade database to create two new tables, creating a funciton to transform data, and creating a trigger and stored procedure to update them when data is entered into the database. 

The business case for this DVD store is to track and compare monthly rentals between their two locations.
